I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, studying Computer Science with a focus on AI, NLP, and Data Mining. My research interests lie around the applications of AI to solve real-world problems.

Currently, I am working with Prof. Jiawei Han on developing tools that enhance causal reasoning and event extraction using LLMs, with a focus on improving their ability to capture temporal and causal relationships in real-world datasets. I also collaborate with Prof. Koustuv Saha on exploring the impact of LLMs in the workplace. I also work closely with the NASA SERVIR team on environmental monitoring and geospatial intelligence projects. My recent work explores how advanced AI tools can better understand complex information, extract meaningful insights, and assist in real-world decision-making. 

I have previously gained industry experience through internships at Nvidia and other leading tech companies, contributing to AI research and building high-impact software tools.
